## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add sms_code to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:

        def deps do
          [{:sms_code, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure sms_code is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:sms_code]]
        end
